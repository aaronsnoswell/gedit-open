gedit-open
==========

This script maps the command "g" to open Gedit in the current working directory.

Steps:
1. Place the file "g" in your ~/bin directory
2. Make sure  ~/bin is on your path. You can do this by running the below command

> if [[ ! $PATH =~ ~/bin ]]; then echo "# Add our bin directory to the PATH\nPATH=~/bin:\"\${PATH}\"" >> ~/.bashrc; echo "Added ~/bin to your .bashrc file"; else echo "~/bin is already on your PATH"; fi;

You can now run the command "g" to open everyone's favourite text editor :) You
can also pass in filenames as arguments, any files that exist and are of
mime-type "text" will be opened, files that don't exist will be created then
openend. Examples:

> g
> g file1.txt file2.html
> g *

Happy Coding!
